= Using the Annotation Based Router API

In Beverage Buddy, we are using the annotation based router API. The following sections demonstrate the usage of the new API through snippets from the code.

== Defining the routes with @Route
In the annotation based router API, different routes are defined by annotating your target classes with `@Route`.
[source, java]
--------------
@Route(value = "", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class ReviewsList extends PolymerTemplate<ReviewsModel> {
}
--------------
[source, java]
--------------
@Route(value = "categories", layout = MainLayout.class)
public class CategoriesList extends Div {
}
--------------

Here, we have two views, for listing reviews and categories, respectively.
As you notice, the value of the `@Route' annotation for the reviews view is
empty, which means it is the *default* route target for this application.

[NOTE]
`MainLayout.class` is declared as the parent layout here. In order for a class
to be used as a parent layout, it must implement the `RouterLayout` interface.

In annotation based router API, the servlet will be registered automatically by
mapping the `@Route` annotation from each navigation target, so there is no need
to declare it manually.

== Navigating between routes
After defining the routes, you can use `RouterLink` to create the links in `MainLayout`.
[source, java]
--------------
reviews = new RouterLink(null, ReviewsList.class);
reviews.add(new Icon(VaadinIcons.LIST), new Text("Reviews"));
categories = new RouterLink(null, CategoriesList.class);
categories.add(new Icon(VaadinIcons.ARCHIVES), new Text("Categories"));
--------------
[TIP]
You can also add a URL parameter in the `RouterLink` component.

# BeverageBuddy App Starter for Flow
## (Aka Beverage Buddy :coffee::tea::sake::baby_bottle::beer::cocktail::tropical_drink::wine_glass:)

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own awesome Flow applications.

The App Starter demonstrates the core Flow concepts:
* Building UIs from Flow components such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker` or `Grid`
* Creating forms with `Binder`
* Making reusable Components on server side with `Composite` (`BeanEditorDialog`)
* Creating a view based on a HTML Template (`ReviewsList`) [documentation](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/polymer-template-based-view.asciidoc#polymer-template-based-view)
* Implementing a view entirely from server side Components (`CategoriesList`)
* Integrating a third-party Web Component (`PaperToast`) [documentation](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/integrating-a-web-component.asciidoc#integrating-a-web-component)
* Navigating views with Annotation-Based Router API (`@Route`)

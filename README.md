# Free Starter for Flow
## (Aka Beverage Buddy :coffee::tea::sake::baby_bottle::beer::cocktail::tropical_drink::wine_glass:)

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own awesome Flow applications.

The Starter demonstrates the core Flow concepts:
* Building UIs from Flow components such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker` or `Grid`
* [Creating forms with `Binder`](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-binder-in-reviewform.asciidoc#using-binder-in-reviewform)
* Making reusable Components on server side with `Composite` (`AbstractEditorDialog`)
* [Creating a view based on a HTML Template](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/polymer-template-based-view.asciidoc#polymer-template-based-view) (`ReviewsList`) 
* Implementing a view entirely from server side Components (`CategoriesList`)
* [Integrating a third-party Web Component](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/integrating-a-web-component.asciidoc#integrating-a-web-component) (`PaperToast`) 
* [Navigating views with Annotation-Based Router API](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-annotation-based-router-api.asciidoc#using-the-annotation-based-router-api) (`@Route`)

# Free App Starter for Flow
## (Aka Beverage Buddy :coffee: :tea: :sake: :baby_bottle: :beer: :cocktail: :tropical_drink: :wine_glass:)

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own awesome Flow applications.

It demonstrates the core Flow concepts, such as how to 
* use various Flow components such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker` or `Grid`,
* build forms with `Binder`,
* implement reusable components on server side using `Composite` (`BeanEditorDialog`),
* implement a template based view (`ReviewsList`),
* implement a view entirely from server side components (`CategoriesList`),
* import and use a Polymer component (`PaperToast`).

## Prerequisites

## Running the Project

1. Run using
```mvn clean jetty:run```
2. Wait for the application to start

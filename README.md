# Free App Starter for Flow
## (Aka Beverage Buddy :coffee::tea::sake::baby_bottle::beer::cocktail::tropical_drink::wine_glass:)

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own awesome Flow applications.

The app demonstrates the core Flow concepts:
* Building UIs from Flow components such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker` or `Grid`
* Creating forms with `Binder`
* Making reusable components on server side with `Composite` (`BeanEditorDialog`)
* Creating a Component based on a HTML template (`ReviewsList`)
* Implementing a view entirely from server side components (`CategoriesList`)
* Integrating a third-party Web Component (`PaperToast`)

## Prerequisites

The project can be imported into the IDE of your choice as a Maven project.

## Running the Project

1. Run using
```mvn clean jetty:run```
2. Wait for the application to start
3. Open http://localhost:8080/ to view the application

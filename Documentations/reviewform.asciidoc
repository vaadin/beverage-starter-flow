ReviewForm-Doc
--------------
Review form is a class built based on the GeneratedPaperDialog, where it integrates several web components, such as `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker`, `Label` and `TextField`. Besides, a nested dialog is implemented.

This class will be called for two use cases:

* After the user clicks the "Add a new review" button
* After the user clicks the "Edit" button

In this documentation, concepts used in ``ReviewForm.java`` will be introduced.

Binder
~~~~~~
Between the form and the backend data, `Binder` provides a bridge to connect the property names with its related values, so that you can use `readBean` and `writeBean` methods to deal with data easily.

Furthermore, `Binder` offers an easy way to validate the input data.
Let's make the property "Beverage Name" as an example:
[source, java]
--------------
//declare a Binder for review class
private Binder<Review> binder = new Binder<>(Review.class);
private TextField beverageName = new TextField();

public ReviewForm(){
  //bind the related property with the value
  //set a validator to make sure the beverage name is longer than 3 characters
  binder.forField(beverageName).withValidator(name -> name.length() >= 3,
               "The name of the beverage should contain at least three characters.")
               .bind(Review::getName, Review::setName);
  }

--------------
Beside the validator, in order to manipulate the data, you might also need a converter. For more about the content related to `Binder`, you can check *https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/flow-documentation/binding-data/tutorial-flow-components-binder-beans.asciidoc[Tutorial for Binder^]*.

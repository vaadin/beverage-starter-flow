<!-- This file is used only for making a production version of the app (mvn install -PproductionMode).
     This file is needed by the `polymer build` process to transpile to ES5, minify
     and bundle the client side code. The build process goes through imported files
     recursively, so you only need to point to all top level template files here. -->
